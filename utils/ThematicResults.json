Personally, I usually use AI to generate content with a more neutral tone, focusing on factual accuracy rather than adding strong emotions. This makes it a bit challenging for me to adapt to this app. However, it was the first time I became aware of the potential emotional bias in sentences, and I also realized how difficult it can be to accurately convey subtleties of emotions through AI",
